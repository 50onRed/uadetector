                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &amp;lt;http://fsf.org/&amp;gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.

  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library</pre></div>

				<b>2. Fair Dealing Rights.</b>
				Nothing in this
				License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses

			<p>
				<b>3. License Grant.</b>
				Subject to the terms
				and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
				a worldwide, royalty-free,
				non-exclusive, perpetual (for
				the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
				exercise the rights in the Work as
				stated below:
			</p>

			<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
				<li>to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
					one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
					incorporated in the Collections;
				</li>

				<li>to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
					such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
					takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
					otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
					Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The
					original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or
					a
					modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been
					modified.&quot;;
				</li>

				<li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
					as incorporated in Collections; and,
				</li>

				<li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.</li>

				<li>
					<p>For the avoidance of doubt:</p>

					<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
						<li>
							<b>Non-waivable Compulsory License
								Schemes
							</b>
							. In those jurisdictions in which the
							right to collect royalties through any statutory or
							compulsory licensing
							scheme cannot be waived, the
							Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such

							You of the rights
							granted under this License;

						<li>
							<b>Waivable Compulsory License
								Schemes
							</b>

							royalties for any exercise by You of
							the rights
							granted under this License; and,
						</li>

						<li>
							<b>Voluntary License Schemes</b>
							. The
							Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
							whether individually or, in the event that the
							Licensor is a
							member of a collecting society that
							administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
							society, from any exercise by
							You of the rights
							granted under this License.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and
				formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
				rights
				include the right to make such modifications as are
				technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
				and
				formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
				expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>4. Restrictions.</b>
				The license granted in
				Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
				the following restrictions:
			</p>

			<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
				<li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
					under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
					of,
					or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
					License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
					Publicly
					Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
					on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
					the ability of
					the recipient of the Work to exercise the
					rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
					License. You may
					not sublicense the Work. You must keep
					intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
					disclaimer of
					warranties with every copy of the Work You
					Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
					Publicly Perform
					the Work, You may not impose any
					effective technological measures on the Work that
					restrict the ability of a
					recipient of the Work from You
					to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
					the terms of the License. This
					Section 4(a) applies to
					the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
					not require the Collection apart from
					the Work itself to
					be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
					create a Collection, upon notice from any
					Licensor You
					must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
					Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
					requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
					any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
					from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
					4(b), as requested.
				</li>

				<li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
					any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
					request has
					been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
					intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
					reasonable to the
					medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
					the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
					applicable) if supplied,
					and/or if the Original Author
					and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
					a sponsor institute,
					publishing entity, journal) for
					attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor's
					copyright notice, terms of service
					or by other reasonable
					means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
					of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
					extent reasonably
					practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
					be associated with the Work, unless such
					URI does not
					refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
					for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section
					3(b), in
					the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
					of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French
					translation
					of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on
					original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit
					required
					by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any
					reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
					a
					Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
					appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
					Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
					credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
					credits
					for the other contributing authors. For the
					avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
					by this Section
					for the purpose of attribution in the
					manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
					this License, You may
					not implicitly or explicitly assert
					or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
					by the Original Author,
					Licensor and/or Attribution
					Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
					without the separate, express
					prior written permission of
					the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
					Parties.
				</li>

				<li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
					or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
					You
					Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
					either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
					Collections, You
					must not distort, mutilate, modify or
					take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
					which would be prejudicial
					to the Original Author's honor
					or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
					jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any
					exercise of the
					right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
					to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
					distortion,
					mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
					prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
					reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
					appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
					permitted by
					the applicable national law, to enable You
					to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
					this License
					(right to make Adaptations) but not
					otherwise.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				<b>5. Representations, Warranties and
					Disclaimer
				</b>
			</p>

			<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
				WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
				REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
				WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
				WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
				FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
				ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
				PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
				SOME
				JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
				WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>6. Limitation on Liability.</b>
				EXCEPT TO
				THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
				LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
				ANY
				SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
				DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
				WORK,
				EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
				SUCH DAMAGES.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>7. Termination</b>
			</p>

			<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
				<li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will
					terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
					terms of
					this License. Individuals or entities who have
					received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
					License,
					however, will not have their licenses terminated
					provided such individuals or entities remain in full
					compliance with
					those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
					and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
				</li>

				<li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
					license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
					the
					applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
					the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
					Work under
					different license terms or to stop
					distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
					any such election will
					not serve to withdraw this License
					(or any other license that has been, or is required to
					be, granted under the terms
					of this License), and this
					License will continue in full force and effect unless
					terminated as stated above.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				<b>8. Miscellaneous</b>
			</p>

			<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
				<li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
					or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
					license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
					the license granted to You under this License.
				</li>

				<li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
					Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
					the
					original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
					license granted to You under this License.
				</li>

				<li>If any provision of this License is invalid or
					unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
					the
					validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
					terms of this License, and without further action by the
					parties
					to this agreement, such provision shall be
					reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
					provision valid and
					enforceable.
				</li>

				<li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
					waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
					consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
					charged with such waiver or consent.
				</li>

				<li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between
					the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
					are no understandings, agreements or representations with
					respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
					not
					be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
					in any communication from You. This License may not be
					modified without the mutual written agreement of the
					Licensor and You.
				</li>

				<li>The rights granted under, and the subject matter
					referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
					terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
					Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
					1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
					Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
					Treaty of
					1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
					revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
					matter take
					effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
					the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
					the
					corresponding provisions of the implementation of
					those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
					If the
					standard suite of rights granted under applicable
					copyright law includes additional rights not granted
					under this
					License, such additional rights are deemed to
					be included in the License; this License is not intended
					to restrict
					the license of any rights under applicable
					law.
