		<section name="What is UADetector?">
			<p>
				UADetector is a library to identify over 190 different desktop and mobile browsers and 130 other User-Agents like
				feed readers, email clients and multimedia players. In addition, even more than 400 robots like BingBot, Googlebot
				or Yahoo Bot can be identified.
			</p>
			<p>
				This library is a free, portable Java library to analyze User-Agent strings. The goal of this library is to detect
				the type and the associated operating system of a client like
				<code>Mobile Firefox 9.0</code>
				on
				<code>Android</code>
				or
				<code>Mobile Safari 5.1</code>
				on
				<code>iOS</code>
				.
			</p>
			<p>
				UADetector is divided into two modules. The
				<a href="modules/uadetector-core/index.html">Core</a>
				module includes the API and implementation to read detection information and functions to identify User-Agents. The
				<a href="modules/uadetector-resources/index.html">Resources</a>
				module contains the database with all necessary identification informations and a service factory class to get
				simply preconfigured UserAgentStringParser singletons. The Resources library is published monthly and is
				integration-tested against a specific Core module. Therefore we can guarantee that the parsing works like expected.

					All classes in this library have been especially tested. The unit tests have over 90%
					<a href="modules/uadetector-core/cobertura/index.html">branch</a>
					and
					<a href="modules/uadetector-core/cobertura/index.html">line</a>
					coverage. In addition, many integration tests performed regularly.
