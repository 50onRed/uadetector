UADetector
==========


What is UADetector?
-----

UADetector is a library to identify over 190 different desktop and mobile
browsers and 130 other User-Agents like feed readers, email clients and
multimedia players. In addition, even more than 400 robots like BingBot,
Googlebot or Yahoo Bot can be identified.

The UADetector library is a free, portable Java library to analyze User-Agent
strings. The goal of this library is to detect the type and the associated
operating system of a client like `Mobile Firefox 9.0` on `Android` or `Mobile
Safari 5.1` on `iOS`.

The UADetector library is divided into two modules. The core module includes
the API and implementation to read the detection information and the functions
to identify User-Agents. The resources module contains the database with the
necessary identification information and a service factory class to get simply
preconfigured UserAgentStringParser singletons. This library will be published
monthly, is integration-tested against the core module and is guaranteed to run
against the defined core.
